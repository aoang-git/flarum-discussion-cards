# Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2025-05-29
### Changed
- Cards now link to the discussion's first unread post (reply) or to the last post if all are read.
- Number of replies on cards now shows the number of unread replies (with an **asterisk**) when there are unread replies, and the total number of replies otherwise (discussion fully read).

### Fixed
- cards didn't display when at least one discussion had a FOF Best Answer badge and show badges was activated. (partial fix as the Best Answer badge is displayed without icon or color because that data isn't passed to the payload by the FOF Best Answer extension) so still WIP but not a breaking bug annymore.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-12-17
### Added
- NEW option to show the number of replies on the right side of a card's title (like the default Flarum design) instead of on the image.
- NEW option to show the last post informations on the cards (like the default Flarum design): username & date of last post.
- NEW FEATURE: support for `shebaoting/repost` extension.
- New migration file for the aforementioned new options & features.
- Post image search function now detects images in posts set via inline styles property `background: url(...)` or `background-image: url()`, like for the thumbnails in YouTube video embeds.

### Changed
- The way read cards are marked (removed B&W filter): now read cards' title and text have a lighter font weight (like the default Flarum discussion list behavior)
- When there are too many tags, not all of them where visible: now they will scroll horizontally when you hover on the cards' tag list on desktop and you can manually scroll them on mobile.
